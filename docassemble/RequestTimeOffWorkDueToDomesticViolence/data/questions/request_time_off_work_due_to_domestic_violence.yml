question: |
  Legal protections for time off
subquestion: |
  The Victims’ Economic Security and Safety Act (VESSA) became a law in Illinois in August, 2003. VESSA describes what employers must do to help survivors of **{domestic violence}** and **{sexual violence}** keep their jobs and stay safe.

  You are protected by VESSA if you are a survivor of domestic violence or sexual violence, or if you are helping a family or household member who is a survivor.
  
  ${ collapse_template(vessa_intro_b) }  
terms:
  sexual violence: |
    Sexual violence can be sexual assault, non-consensual sexual acts, or sex with a minor.
  domestic violence: |
    Domestic violence can be physical abuse, harassment, or intimidation of family or other household members.
---
template: vessa_intro_b
subject: |
  **How much time off can I get?**
content: |
  The amount of unpaid time off you get under VESSA depends on the number of employees at your job and whether your employer is a government agency.
  This program will ask you questions about your employer to determine how much time off you can get.
